Hi, I'm Thomas!
I'm 16 and from Australia.

[Check out my website!](https://thomasluigi07.com/)

I make Roblox games, applications and websites. I also like using Skeuomorphic design for most of my projects, because I like that kind of design.

I mainly code in HTML, CSS, C# and Luau (Roblox Lua). I also know a little bit of Javascript, Objective-C, PHP and Swift, but I'm still learning it.
