Hi, I'm Thomas G, also known as Thomasluigi07.
I'm 17 and from Sydney, Australia.

I used to make Roblox games, but now I make applications and websites (rarely). I also like using Skeuomorphic design for most of my projects, because I think it looks cool.

I'd say I'm pretty good at coding with Lua, HTML and CSS. My Javascript, PHP, Swift, Objective-C, C# or Shell Scripts skills are very limited, so I don't make many things with them.
